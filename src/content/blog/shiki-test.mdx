One advanced feature of Neovim is the ability to create your own windows and
assign them to shortcuts. To make a fully featured window, create a buffer, then
a window with that buffer, and then assign keymaps local to that buffer.

## diff

```ts twoslash
import { Octokit } from "octokit";
const token = "blah";
const octokitService = new Octokit({ auth: token });

console.log("hewwo"); // [!code --]
console.log("hello"); // [!code ++]
console.log("goodbye");
```
