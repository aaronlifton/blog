Lattiude is a new, open-source source for embedding an analytics platform on top
of your already-existing SQL-based DB. Postgres, SQLite, DuckDB, and many more
databases are supported. On the application side, all the developer has to do is
write custom SQL queries, and these queries will be automatically served on a
custom endpoint which is read by the Lattitude server. In this example, we'll
use an example Rails app that has 3 models, `Family`, `Account`, and
`Transaction`.

First,
[download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/latitude-dev/sample-duckdb/main/queries/netflix.csv)
the sample csv and put it in `db/data/netflix.csv`.
