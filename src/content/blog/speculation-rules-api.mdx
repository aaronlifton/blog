Enabling the Speculation Rules API with AstroJS

In the modern web development landscape, page loading speed is integral to user
experience. any web application. Speculation Rules API, an experimental feature,
is pretty much a game changer, as page loads will become instant as the client
fetches them, based on pre-configured rules. This post is intended to guide
developers through the process of integrating the Speculation Rules API with
AstroJS.

## Integration of Speculation Rules API with AstroJS

AstroJS is my favorite frontend framework, because it allows you to create a
"turtles all the way down"-style component heirarchy [@fn1](). This means you can
use Svelte components, inside of Astro components, inside of Lit components, and
so-on. This is a great way to learn a new framework, and in my opinion, this is
the best framework for developing "developer blogs", as many others have also
done. This site is implemented in AstroJS as well. is a front-end framework that

AstroJS enables you to pre-render your prefetched pages on the client in
supported browsers\[^5^\]. Additionally, AstroJS overrides the standard prefetch
behavior, globally applying the Speculation Rules API to prerender links on the
client\[^4^\].

This is done by configuring the `astro.config.mjs` file\[^4^\]. Once you include
desired `prefetch` configurations in this file, the experimental Speculation
Rules API kicks in, preparing the page for quicker—sometimes instant—page
loads\[^2^\]. Here's how to enable this in the Astro configuration:

```javascript
{
  prefetch: {
    prefetchAll: true,
    defaultStrategy: 'viewport',
  },
  experimental: {
    clientPrerender: true,
  },
}
```

## Prerendering with Speculation Rules API

Prerendering is a technique used by browsers to load a document before it's
needed, such as while hovering over a link\[^fn3]. The Speculation Rules API
enhances this by allowing you to prefetch and **(most importantly)**, prerender
the next page navigation[^fn2]. This results in basically instant page loads,
leading to the sought-after "desktop app"-like user experience[^fn2].

With the Speculation Rules API, speculation rules are taken in the form of a
JSON structure that determines what resources should be prefetched or
prerendered by the browser. So, developers the room to define rules by
which certain URLs are dynamically prefetched or prerendered based on user
interaction[^fn3]. Here's an example of how the `speculationrules` attribute
might be used in a script tag:

```html
<script type="speculationrules">

{

  "prerender": [

    {"source": "list", "urls": ["/about", "/contact", "/blog"]}

  ]

}

</script>
```

\
However, no actual speculation is being done. One possible way to prerender
the "right" pages, so as to not waste countless CPU cycles, is to load user
favorites, like favorite brands on an e-commerce, or their most frequently
accessed pages.

```html
<script type="javascript">
  const session = Session.current()
  const userFavorites = API.Brands.favorites({user}).sortBy((brandA) =>
    brand.viewCount - brandB.viewCount
  )
</script>
<script type="speculationrules">

  {

    "prerender": [

      {"source": "list", "urls": userFavorites.slice(10)}

    ]

  }

</script>
```

\
Note that before implementing this, you should review the possible risks when
prerendering on the client[^fn1]. Debugging speculation rules can be tricky,
particularly for prerendered pages[^fn2]. However, Chrome provides developer
tools with the `performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0].activationStart`
function that allows you to verify if a page was prerendered[^fn3].
