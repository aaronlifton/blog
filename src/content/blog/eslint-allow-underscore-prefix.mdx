import { Code } from "astro:components";
import { Image } from "astro:assets"
import ZoomableImage from "../../components/ZoomableImage.astro"
import ZoomImage from "../../components/ZoomImage.svelte"
import image1 from "./assets/screenshots/nvim-no-unused-vars2.png";

Ever encounter this error?
```sh
eslint: '\_myVar' is assigned a value but never used'
```
Ideally the `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule can be left enabled
and specific variables can be ignored when prefixed with an underscore `_`. You
can do exactly this in a few simple steps.

## The Steps

First, update your `.eslintrc.json` as follows:

```json
{
  "eslintConfig": {
    "rules": {
      "no-unused-vars": "off",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": [
        "warn",
        {
          "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",
          "varsIgnorePattern": "^_",
          "caughtErrorsIgnorePattern": "^_"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This allows you to prefix any variable with `_` to be ignored by `ESLint`,
including those in destructuring assignments.

After updating the `.eslintrc.json` as follows, I could then prefix any
  variable with an underscore to have it be ignored by `ESLint`:

```js annotate
const [_isZoomVisible, setZoomVisible] = useState(false);
//      ^
//     [added underscore to variable name.]
```

After updating the `eslintConfig`, the error is now gone and ESLint doesn't
complain about the unused variables.
