In neovim, when a word is marked as misspelled, you can add it to the dictionary
by typing <kbd>zg</kbd> while the cursor is on the word. To correct a word from a list of
suggestions, you can type <kbd>z=</kbd>. This is great, but what if you want to add a
custom spelling suggestion? For example, I want to add the word `neovim` to the
dictionary, but I don't want to add it to the dictionary as `neovim`, I want to
add it as `Neovim`, with a capital `N`.

## Configuration
Here's how you do it:

1. Create a custom spelling suggestion file in your neovim configuration
   directory. I called mine `~/.config/nvim/spell/sugg`. You might notice files
   in that folder that end in `.add` â€” the words in these files are
   ignored by spellcheck.

   ```js annotate
   neovim/Neovim
   //------<<
   ```

   If `Neovim` is marked as a misspelled word, type <kbd>zg</kbd> to add it to the
   dictionary.
   \
   **Note**: If the word to the right of the `/` is mispelled, the suggestion
   will be ignored by neovim. Make sure all words on the right are added as
   "goodwords".

   The file should now look like this:
   <ZoomImage link={image1.src} alt={"Full-size neovim screenshot"} caption="Neovim screenshot showing a custom spelling suggestion file" client:load>
     <Image src={image1} width="720"
       alt="Neovim screenshot showing a custom spelling suggestion file"
      class="max-h-full max-w-full m-0"
      />
   </ZoomImage>

1. Add the following to your vim options:

```lua
vim.opt.sps = "file:/Users/aaron/.config/nvim/spell/sugg,best"
```

Now, when editing a file, if `neovim` is marked as a misspelled word, typing
<kbd>z=</kbd> will show `Neovim` as the first suggestion.

## Disabling for syntax
Another thing to note is that there is a configuration option for spellchecking
syntax. Generally, we do not want to spell check function and class names, etc -
the whole page would start to turn red! To ignore certain syntax, add the
following to your vim options:

```lua
vim.cmd("set spell syntax=off")
```
