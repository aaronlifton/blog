To correct a word from a list of\nsuggestions, you can type <kbd>z=</kbd>. This is great, but what if you want to add a\ncustom spelling suggestion? For example, I want to add the word `neovim` to the\ndictionary, but I don't want to add it to the dictionary as `neovim`, I want to\nadd it as `Neovim`, with a capital `N`.\n\n## Configuration\nHere's how you do it:\n\n1. Create a custom spelling suggestion file in your neovim configuration\n   directory. I called mine `~/.config/nvim/spell/sugg`. You might notice files\n   in that folder that end in `.add` â€” the words in these files are\n   ignored by spellcheck.\n\n   ```js annotate\n   neovim/Neovim\n   //------<<\n   ```\n\n   If `Neovim` is marked as a misspelled word, type <kbd>zg</kbd> to add it to the\n   dictionary.\n   \\\n   **Note**: If the word to the right of the `/` is mispelled, the suggestion\n   will be ignored by neovim. Make sure all words on the right are added as\n   \"goodwords\".\n\n   The file should now look like this:\n   <ZoomImage link={image1.src} alt={\"Full-size neovim screenshot\"} caption=\"Neovim screenshot showing a custom spelling suggestion file\" client:load>\n     <Image src={image1} width=\"720\"\n       alt=\"Neovim screenshot showing a custom spelling suggestion file\"\n      class=\"max-h-full max-w-full m-0\"\n      />\n   </ZoomImage>\n\n1. Add the following to your vim options:\n\n```lua\nvim.opt.sps = \"file:/Users/aaron/.config/nvim/spell/sugg,best\"\n```\n\nNow, when editing a file, if `neovim` is marked as a misspelled word, typing\n<kbd>z=</kbd> will show `Neovim` as the first suggestion.\n\n## Disabling for syntax\nAnother thing to note is that there is a configuration option for spellchecking\nsyntax. Generally, we do not want to spell check function and class names, etc -\nthe whole page would start to turn red! To ignore certain syntax, add the\nfollowing to your vim options:\n\n```lua\nvim.cmd(\"set spell syntax=off\")\n```\n\n";
